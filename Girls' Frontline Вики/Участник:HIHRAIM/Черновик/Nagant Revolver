| weaponinfo =
The Nagant M1895 is a seven-shot revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant revolver was chambered for a proprietary 7.62×38mmR cartridge, and featured an unusual "gas-seal" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver).<ref name= "wiki">[[wikipedia:Nagant M1895|Wikipedia entry on Nagant M1895]]</ref>
